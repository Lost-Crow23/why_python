<h1>Why Python</h1>

<h3>Why is python popular?</h3>

Can create complex, multi-protocol applications whilst the syntax is concise and readable. It’s easy to learn with simple syntax and execution is made faster and involves hundreds of python libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy Django, and SciPy. Among the community, it has grown exponentially which includes plenty of materials, guides for all ages and learners to grasp knowledge.  It’s very versatile and efficient to complete codes for any given project and can be done in any kind of environment.

 <h3>Different ways of python are in use?</h3>

Mainly, used for development of websites and software, automation of tasks, data science and data visualization. Famously, it is used for big data, machine learning, and cloud computing, which transforms and improves their processes and workflows. It’s the first choice of language for most programmers as it currently stands in high demand in the development market. 

<h3>Who is using python?</h3>

Sectors within the finance sector, aerospace sector, banking, data science, start-ups rely on python. Majority of the companies, like IBM, Intel, NASA, Netflix and Facebook just to name a few are using python. It is essentially the main language at Google. 

 <h3>Why is python demand as a skill?</h3>

As it is popular among many sectors especially data science, it supports the fundamentals firstly like loops, functions, and conditions for compiling software algorithms. It’s relatively easy to learn and boosts the readability which reduces maintenance costs. Big Tech giants use large scale artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to run daily operations. Python becomes a top choice, through the implementation of using such web development frameworks such as Django and flask allowing a streamlined approach to build sites. 


<h3>What kind of salaries is involved as python skilled professional?</h3>

The salaries rise from a junior average of entry level positions from £30,000 among the United Kingdom to senior roles for up to £80,000 a year. These salaries vary within the different roles like Project Manager earning a £60,000 on average, Cyber security analyst earning £45,000, cloud architect, £70,000 and software developers £45,000 and DevOps Engineer earning from £37,000.



<h3>Why is python used in DevOps?</h3>

Python is of the primary technologies that is essential to DevOps. It’s flexibility and accessibility make the language a great fit for the role, as it involves a collaboration within the team to build applications, data visualizations and improve the workflow with custom utilities. It is mandatory as a engineer to have basic understanding of languages, such like Java and Python. You can do pretty much do anything from automating the life cycle and infrastructure of the deployment, CI/CD pipeline, python as a script for checking and monitoring tasks. Examples like, making automation tools to check on servers, check network devices, disk drives, and build failure models. Benefits include, efficiency, Agile programming, adapting to changes, Easy syntax, and lastly just a great combination. Python is one of the best scripting languages. The vast variety of python libraries allows us to write scripts for the improved development life cycle. Python provides the frameworks to write structured and readable automation scripts.
